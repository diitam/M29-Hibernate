Entity association-in hibernate entity are classes
	   association- is relation between two entities
			ex-reltion between 2 ppl can be frnd ,classmate etc.
			
why to use association-their is no directionality in entities for that we have association
						and thus there are 2 types of association-
											unidirectional-one to one 
														   one to many
														   many to many
											birectional-one to one
														one to many/many to one-without join table
																				with join tble
										
Inheritance is a Is-A relationship
